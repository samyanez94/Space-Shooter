# Space Shooter
This project follows on [Unity Space Shooter Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/space-shooter-tutorial). It's a simple top down arcade style shooter game with a space theme. You can control a spaceship using the accelerometer on your device and defeat waves of enemies and asteroids. 

The game was made using the Unity Engine as a way to understand how to work with imported Mesh Models, Audio, Textures and Materials.
